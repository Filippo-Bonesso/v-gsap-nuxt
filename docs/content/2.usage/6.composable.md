# Composable

By default, GSAP is also exported as composable `useGSAP()`

This allows for all cases where the directive doesnt work to just use regular GSAP from the `<script>` section.

You can simply use it like so:

```vue
<script setup>
onMounted(() => {
  useGSAP().to("<selector>", {
    props,
  });
});
</script>
```

## Disabling composable

If you are experiencing issues due to other already existing imports of gsap, you can disable the auto-import of the composable in `nuxt.config.ts` via the `composable: ` property [See more](/installation/configuration)
