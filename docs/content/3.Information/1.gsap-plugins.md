# Adding GSAP Plugins

If you want to add your own GSAP Plugins (like `EasePack`, `PhysicsPropsPlugin`,
etc) you can do so by registering them with the composable `useGSAP()`.

Since it shares the actual gsap instance from the module, plugins only need to
be registered once - preferably as high in the app structure as needed.

::code-group

```vue [app.vue]
<script setup>
import { RoughEase } from 'gsap/EasePack'

onBeforeMount(() => {
  useGSAP().registerPlugin(RoughEase)
})
</script>
```

The following plugins are imported by default as part of the modules featureset
and therefore are not needed to import manually:

- `ScrollTrigger`
- `ScrollToPlugin`
- `Draggable`
- `TextPlugin`
