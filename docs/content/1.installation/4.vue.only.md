# Vue only

Since Version `1.2.1` you can also use this module for Vue - instead of Nuxt.

::alert{type="info"}
This feature is still experimental and to use with caution.
Please report any issues on the [Github Issues Tab](https://github.com/holux-design/v-gsap-nuxt/issues)
::

## 1. Install package

To use with Vue, do not use the auto-install command, since this is a nuxt-specific module install. Instead install the package itself through npm:

```bash [npx]
npm i v-gsap-nuxt
```

## 2. Import directive

In the second step go to your `main.ts` file for your vue app, import the Vue plugin and add it to your app **after initialization and before mount**:

::code-group

  ```ts [main.ts]
	import { vGsapVue } from 'v-gsap-nuxt/vue';

	// const app = createApp(App);
	app.directive('gsap', vGsapVue());
	// app.mount('#app');
::


## Configuration

Since global configuration for nuxt happens in `nuxt.config.ts` which is not available in Vue, you can add these settings directly during initialization. All props are the same as with nuxt.

::code-group

  ```ts [main.ts]
	app.directive('gsap', vGsapVue({
		presets: [],
		breakpoint: 768,
		scroller: '',
		composable: true
	}));
