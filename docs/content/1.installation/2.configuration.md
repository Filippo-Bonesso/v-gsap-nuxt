# Configuration

In general, no config is needed. However, there are some options you can configure:

::code-group

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
vgsap: {
	presets: [],
	breakpoint: 768,
	scroller: ''
}
```

::

- `presets` lets you define reoccuring animations. [See more](/usage/presets)
- `breakpoint` `number` lets you define a custom breakpoint for `.desktop` and `.mobile` modifier
- `scroller` `string` as `selector` lets you define a custom scroller that will be applied to all scrollTriggers
  - This is needed if your content is wrapped in an artificial scroll wrapper, instead of the default document/body
