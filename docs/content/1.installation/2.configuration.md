# Configuration

In general, no config is needed. However, there are some options you can configure:

::code-group

  ```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
  vgsap: {
		presets: []
		breakpoint: 768
	}
  ```
::

- `presets` lets you define reoccuring animations. [See more](/usage/presets)
- `breakpoint` `number` lets you define a custom breakpoint for `.desktop` and `.mobile` modifier
